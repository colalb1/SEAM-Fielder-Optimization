# SEAM Fielder Optimization
This work was completed under the guidance of my adviser [Daniel Eck](https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/dje13) and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Statistics Department for my master's thesis in applied mathematics.

The goal is to use the distributions generated by [SEAM](https://github.com/ecklab/seam) to create optimal batter-pitcher matchup-specific fielder alignments to decrease predicted BABIP via gradient descent techniques. A detailed description of the mathematics and motivation behind this problem can be found in the [thesis](https://github.com/colalb1/SEAM-Fielder-Optimization/blob/main/SEAM-Fielder-Placement-Optimization.pdf).

I will give a short description of each folder's contents.

## Data
**generated fields** contains the standard in-play coordinates for all distributions. The coordinates for Guaranteed Rate Field were used for all testing as it is the most standard-shaped field in the MLB. **seam** contains helper files taken from the [SEAM repository](https://github.com/ecklab/seam) and were mainly used to generate the SEAM distributions for testing. **statcast** contains scraped [Statcast](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search) data. **validation** contains 2022 Statcast data for out-of-sample validation, the table of values generated from the out-of-sample validation, and similarity scores between each (tested) batter and pitcher.


## Fielder Shape Justification
Generates the GAMs trained on Statcast data for each position based on whether they can field a ball in play. This is used to justify the elliptic fielder shape in the optimization's implementation.

## Generating Field Coordinates
File used to filter the SEAM distribution to fair territory for each stadium. The output is a flattened data table containing the in-play coordinates for each stadium.

## Plots
Images of validation results, fielder shape justification, and the "Visualizations" section.

## Validation
*[placement-validation](https://github.com/colalb1/SEAM-Fielder-Optimization/blob/main/validation/placement-validation.Rmd)* contains the main maximization method used to generate the optimal alignments. This was used to produce the validation data. The final section contains a distribution analysis of the generated BABIP reductions. *[optimal-fielder-alignments](https://github.com/colalb1/SEAM-Fielder-Optimization/blob/main/validation/optimal-fielder-alignments.R)* contains essentially the same methods as the previously mentioned file but was used to generate plots. *[getting-pitcher-and-batter-pools](https://github.com/colalb1/SEAM-Fielder-Optimization/blob/main/validation/getting-pitcher-and-batter-pools.R)* find the similarities between each tested batter and pitcher. *[similarity-vs-babip-reduction](https://github.com/colalb1/SEAM-Fielder-Optimization/blob/main/validation/similarity-vs-babip-reduction.R)* was used to extract correlation between predicted BABIP reduction and similarity score. Most of the code from this was omitted because it was trivial.
