# SEAM Fielder Optimization
This work was completed under the guidance of [Daniel Eck](https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/dje13) and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Statistics Department for my master's thesis in applied mathematics.

The goal is to use the distributions generated by [SEAM](https://github.com/ecklab/seam) to create optimal batter-pitcher matchup-specific fielder alignments to decrease predicted BABIP via gradient descent techniques. A detailed description of the mathematics and motivation behind this problem can be found in the [thesis](https://github.com/colalb1/SEAM-Fielder-Optimization/blob/main/SEAM-Fielder-Placement-Optimization.pdf).
