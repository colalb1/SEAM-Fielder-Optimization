# SEAM Fielder Optimization
This work was completed under the guidance of [Daniel Eck](https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/dje13) and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Statistics Department for my master's thesis in applied mathematics.

The goal is to use the distributions generated by [SEAM](https://github.com/ecklab/seam) to create optimal batter-pitcher matchup-specific fielder alignments to decrease predicted BABIP via gradient descent techniques. A detailed description of the mathematics and motivation behind this problem can be found in the [thesis](https://github.com/colalb1/SEAM-Fielder-Optimization/blob/main/SEAM-Fielder-Placement-Optimization.pdf).

I will give a short description of each folder's contents.

## Data
**Generated Fields** contains the standard in-play coordinates for all distributions. The coordinates for Guaranteed Rate Field were used for all testing as it is the most standard-shaped field in the MLB. **seam** contains helper files taken from the [SEAM repository](https://github.com/ecklab/seam) and were mainly used to generate the SEAM distributions for testing. **statcast** contains scraped [Statcast](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search) data. **validation** contains 2022 Statcast data for out-of-sample validation, the table of values generated from the out-of-sample validation, and similarity scores between each batter and pitcher.
